# Hi, I'm Giulia! 👋🏻

I'm a fullstack web developer and career changer. With 6+ years of experience in SaaS sales and account management, I've honed my skills in customer-facing roles and learned the importance of clear communication and expectation management. I'm looking forward to applying my technicals skills to real-world projects. 

As a language enthusiast and diversity advocate, I love connecting with people from all walks of life and promoting inclusion in the tech industry (check out what I'm doing with [the D2 Collective] (https://thed2collective.community/page/start-here)!)

Outside of coding & technology, I'm very passionate about stand-up comedy, mental health and creating endless Google Maps list with all of my favorite food and coffee spots.
