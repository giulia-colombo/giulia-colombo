# Hi, I'm Giulia! üëãüèª

I recently graduated from a web development bootcamp, and I'm very excited to dive into the world of development. With over 5 years of experience in SaaS sales and account management, I've honed my skills in customer-facing roles and learned the importance of clear communication and expectation management. I'm looking forward to applying my technicals skills to real-world projects and collaborate with teams cross-fucntionally to find efficient solutions. 

As a language enthusiast and diversity advocate, I love connecting with people from all walks of life and promoting inclusion in the tech industry (check out what I'm doing with [the D2 Collective] (https://thed2collective.community/page/start-here)!)

Outside of coding & technology, I'm passionate about subscribing to 12.5 new podcasts every week, stand-up comedy, mental health + accessible mental health care for everybody & creating endless Google Maps list with all of my favorite food and coffee spots around the world.
